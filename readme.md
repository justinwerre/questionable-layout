Questionable Layout is a small Google chrome extension that reorganizes the layout of the main page of questionablecontent.net. It moves the news to its own section below the comic and ensures that the two sections are the same width, creating a slightly cleaner look to the site. Created primarily to test creating Google chrome extensions. To use the extension, download and extract the extension to your computer. Make sure that developer mode is enabled in chrome://extensions and then drag the extension into chrome. When you go to Questionable Contents main page, you should see the new layout.
